A second year student studying Computer Science at the University of Bath. I'm currently learning Python and Java, and soon will be covering some MatLab and other languages in the coming year. I'm interested in software development and project management, and hope to pursue a career in tech after graduation. Here you'll find some of the courseworks I coded as part of my university learning.
